				<h4><b>Dell Laptop That Can Do Everything</b></h4>
				<p>
					<b>CPU:</b> INTEL CORE i5-8305G	<br>
					<b>GRAPHICS:</b> RADEON RX VEGA M GL <br>
					<b>RAM:</b> 8GB DDR4 <br>
					<b>STORAGE:</b> 256GB PCIE SSD <br>
					<b>PRICE:</b> $1500	<br>
					<br>
					The Dell xps-2-in-1 can "do everything". He explains that it's not a gaming laptop so curb expectations in this regard but the gaming on this laptop is like night and day difference compared to Intel's own integrated graphics. Esports can break 60 fps but there may be heat issues when the high-performance load is placed on it and clock speed can be reduced.
					He says “In a 2in1 laptop gaming is a bonus” adding that the laptop is intended for day to day use. 

					The design of the laptop is a bit "edgy" according to Linus but it has a premium build quality. The laptop has 4 type-c ports with 2 being thunderbolt 3 along with an SD card reader. It has an excellent screen with touch functionality. Linus recommends the 1080p variant as it was hard to tell the difference between it and 4k display side by side with the naked eye but easy with the wallet. Dell created a new type of keyboard for this laptop which would feel much more tactile, it was worth it after getting used to. The laptop's speakers sound good at lower volume but start distorting above 50% and sound bad at full volume. The laptop has a fingerprint sensor built in the power button but it has bad camera placement in the chin which is better used in tablet mode. The battery tests got them around 5 hours of use and besides storage, nothing can be upgraded thus Linus recommends "Be sure to get the specs you want".

					In the end, he says "For someone who needs a do it all device and can live without full dedicated graphics the XPS 15 2in1 looks like a solid option". <br>
