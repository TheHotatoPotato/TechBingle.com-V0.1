				<h4><b>$800 Acer Nitro 5</b></h4>
			<p>
				<b>CPU:</b> intel i5-8300H (differs across models) <br>
				<b>GPU:</b> 1050 Ti <br>
				<b>RAM:</b> 8GB (upto 32GB) <br>
				<b>STORAGE:</b> 256GB SSD <br>
				<br>
				Acer is proud to present its new Nitro 5. This gaming laptop has the latest 8th gen processor and a GTx 1050Ti.
				What makes them proud is the really competitive price point for such an experience. The 8th gen core i5 is "nearly identical" 
				to the last gen core i7 7700HQ which was a standard for gaming laptops.
				For a $800 price point the 2556GB SSD really shines as
				we don't have to rely on a larger hard drive to install games on and the SSD is PCI based "being an extra bonus". The 1050 Ti
				is "over a hundered percent faster" than the 950M that we would've got in a $800 laptop in the past. With specs like these 
				we are guranteed to get a "great experince in e-sports titles". Triple-A titles can be run at the native 1080p resolution at 
				medium settings. Talking about the IO, there is one USB 3.0, an HDMI port, an SD card reader and a regular wired ethernet port on the left hand side.
				On the other side there is the power port, two USB 2.0 ports and a headphone/microphone combo jack. The IPS dislplay has "good brightness". Linus likes
				the keyboard though he comments on the long keystroke but overall his impressions are good. You can get it for $800 from Best Buy.(Great Deal!) <br>
