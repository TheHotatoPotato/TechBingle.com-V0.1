				<h4><b>Best Gaming Keyboard?</b></h4>
				<p>
					The <b>Razer  'Huntsman’</b> starting at a <b>$150</b>. What’s different about this keyboard is that it has an ‘OPTO-MECHANICAL SWITCH’. A standard mechanical keyboard has a button at the bottom of the key which sends a signal to the computer after being pressed. But this keyboard has a beam of laser which when gets cut and sends a signal to the computer that a key has been pressed. So with this keyboard you don’t have to wait for the button to be fully pressed against the spring and also not worry about double pressing a key and it’s also RGB. The keys are designed in a way so that wherever you press them it will feel like you have pressed them from the middle. Response times are 30% faster than a mechanical clicking switch and a very light 45g of actuation force is required to initiate a key signal. “What I really care about is how it actually feels to use”.
					<br>
					The keyboard comes in two models. The standard version and an ‘Elite’ version. The ‘Elite’ version has some keys and an RGB wrist rest. There’s no difference in the keys and switches. 
					<br>
					After playing some Fortnite with the ‘Huntsman’ and a $40 mechanical keyboard Austin is surprised to notice a little difference in latency of the keyboards. The ‘Huntsman’ obviously being faster and “the feel” is very good. “The ultimate gaming keyboard of 2018”.
