				The transparent smartphone is here. Got to say it looks pretty damn cool. This phone is kind of a move from HTC to regain their former glory. Looking at the phone itself, it is something really “different and is gonna catch some attention”. The region around the fingerprint sensor at the back is where the ‘transparency’ effect is added.
				With a type-c headset that is said to have good noise-cancellation the buttons on the sides don’t physically depress and “instead there is a little bit of haptic feedback”. Lew talks about how nice the build quality is and the weight feels “nice”.  Speakers are located at the bottom with the type-c connector. As you probably know by now there is no headphone jack.
				There are dual front facing cameras that are just for portrait mode. There is no wide-angle or zoom functionality in them. <br>
