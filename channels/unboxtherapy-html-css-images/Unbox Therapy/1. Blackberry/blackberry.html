				In this video Lewis (Unbox therapy) switches to blackberry key2 as his daily driver. The first thing he notes is the security of the phone and recommends it for people who are security conscious. The phone also has a programmable button which could be used to add up to three shortcuts. According to Lewis, the phone isn't as heavy as it looks. The phone comes with a fingerprint reader that's underneath the spacebar button on the physical keyboard. The keyboard felt satisfying according to Lewis. The keyboard is also a touchpad which could be used to scroll through the screen. The phone has a blackberry launcher on top of Android in which a right swipe from a certain area brings up the productivity tab (things like calendar, messages, contacts etc.), you can have keyboard shortcuts to open certain apps along with this there is a monitoring service built in which monitors the overall security of the device. The screen was usable but not the greatest display he'd ever seen in the opinion of Lewis and the speakers were average. The back camera was decent while the front camera not that much, it was on the lower side.
