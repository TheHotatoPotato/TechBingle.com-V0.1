				In this video Lewis unbox's the surface book 2 convertible laptop, the highest spec level. The power brick comes with an extra USB port. The charging port is magnetic, underneath which is a USB type-c port, on the other side there are two standard USB ports with an sd card reader and there is also a headphone jack. They keyboard is chicklet along with a decent trackpad and the surface book also has a decent display. The speakers are also pretty decent. There is a button on the keyboard that detaches the display turning it into a tablet. The entire package is 3.4 pounds with most of the weight being in the keyboard. The battery life as per Microsoft is 17 hours, with 5 hours being on the tablet while the rest of the 12 hours in the keyboard. The pen is also pretty decent. <br>
