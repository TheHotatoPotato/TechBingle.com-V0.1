				<h4><b>$2400! Sennheiser HD 820!</b></h4>
				<p>
					With 56mm drivers and an over-ear design these headphones are beast. According to Marques, these headphones are worth it. With a super wide soundstage like open back high-end headphones but with all the benefits of closed back headphones. These headphones are massive compared to others and are meant to sit back and enjoy the sound. Due to them being closed back the sound bleed is reduced significantly but not completely. Marques said this was an amazing listening experience. He loved raising the volume as the listening experience according to him just became more full rather than distorted and ear hurting. To drive these headphones he used an Apollo twin mark 2 while listening to compressed files. He recommends listening to <b>Contact</b> by Daft Punk, <b>Strobe</b> by Deadmau5, <b>Says Nada</b>b> by Shakka and <b>anything</b> by 20syl.
