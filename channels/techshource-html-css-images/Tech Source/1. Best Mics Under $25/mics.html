				<h4><b>Best Plug n’ Play Mics Under $25 from Tech Source</b></h4>
				<p>
					<b>#1 FIFINE (Best-$22)</b> <br>
					Comes with a tiny metal tripod which can only be used to adjust the tilt angle. It comes with a removable wind screen. Has a black color which “makes it perfect for most setups and sound quality is very clear and crisp”. Can be used for “voice-overs and semiprofessional audio work in the right environment”.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>#2 KLIM (Excellent-$25)</b> <br>
					This mic can be used both on PS4 and PC. Comes with a built in adjustable stand with a game control wheel and a mute switch. Comes with only a black and red design. “Solid mic for the price”.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>#3 SUMGOT (Good-$19)</b> <br>
					It is a generic BM800 microphone. This one is the highest rated and the lowest priced. Comes with a removable wind screen shock mount and an XLR to 3.5mm jack. This mic does not come with a stand or a boom arm and a separate stand has to be bought.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>#4 TONOR (Ok-$12)</b> <br>
					Very popular on amazon. Comes with a tripod that can be used to adjust the tilt angle and comes with a “long red cable” with a 3.5mm jack. It is excellent for blocking out the background noise. “The mic had decent quality and is definitely not the best from the list” and “for the price, it’s decent”.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>#5 EBERRY (Worst-$7)</b> <br>
					It is a USB microphone and “is easily the worst sounding microphone from the list”. It costs only around $7. It is perfect for laptops and travel due to the small compact size. Not recommended for “gaming” or any “serious audio work”. Perfect for people who only need a microphone and not care for the quality of it.
